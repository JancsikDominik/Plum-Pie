# Main goal
I'll be making a rendering API in opengl, but thats not my goal, I'm doing this to LEARN and explore the vast world of 3d computer graphics.

# Dependencies
GLEW 2.1.0, GLFW 3.3.8, GLM 0.9.9.8

## Additional infos:
   - GLEW GLUT and GLM should be in folder C:\GL
   - The folders should be named {depencency in upper case}bin (or you can just edit the vs project settings, if you already have them installed)
