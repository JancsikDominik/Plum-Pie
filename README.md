CURRENTLY REPLACING OPENGL WITH VULKAN, SO ALL OPENGL STUFF WILL BE DEPRICATED (see: branch Vulkan)

# PlumPie

PlumPie is a 64 bit rendering framework using Vulkan made by a rookie. My first ever 'big' rendering project.
Currently it only works on windows 10 and 11.
In the future I might make it multi-platform.

Beware the project is WORK IN PROGRESS, and very bare bones right now.

## Dependencies

Vulkan, glfw, glm, stb_images, ImGui 

## Usage

TODO...
