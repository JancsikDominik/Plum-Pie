CURRENTLY REPLACING OPENGL WITH VULKAN (see: branch Vulkan)

# PlumPie

PlumPie is a 64 bit rendering framework using Vulkan made by a rookie. My first ever 'big' rendering project.
Currently it only works on windows 10 and 11.
In the future I might make it multi-platform.

Beware the project is WORK IN PROGRESS, and very bare bones right now.

## Dependencies

Vulkan, glfw, glm, stb_images, ImGui 

## Usage

Feel free to fiddle around, its not really useful for anything as of right now. I use cmake as a build system, only tested stuff on windows with visual studio 2022. To generate the project files just run the GenerateProjectFile.bat file. The only thing you have to have installed is Vulkan, every other dependency is built with the framework.

To install Vulkan go to this [website](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
