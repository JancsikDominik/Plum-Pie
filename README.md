I'm currently rewriting everything, as I want to use Vulkan instead of opengl. Also I'll make the project use cmake.

# PlumPie

PlumPie is a 64 bit rendering framework using Vulkan made by a rookie. My first ever 'big' rendering project.
Currently it only works on windows 10 and 11.
In the future I might make it multi-platform.

Beware the project is WORK IN PROGRESS, and very bare bones right now.

## Dependencies

GLEW , GLFW, GLM, (ImGui in the future)

## Usage
